            <p>Hi, my name is Chris, I am 27 years old and originally from Hollywood, FL. I moved to the Charlotte area in 2008 and graduated from Belmont Abbey
              College in 2014 with Business/Marketing Bachelor's degree. I worked as an office assistant where I interened at Southern Advantage, Co. 
              and then was promoted to shipping manager. After a period of time though, I decided it was time for a change and that I wanted to follow a career
              path that truly interested me. This is when I decided to look into coding and eventually made the decision to join the UNCC Coding Bootcamp.
              I hope to excell in the program and eventually land a job in web development where I hope to begin a long and productive career!</p>

        <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 text-center">
            <p>My interests are history, music, art, video games, movies and current events. My hobbies include going to concerts, art galleries, hiking, practicing
              yoga, reading, and I hope to eventually start mountain biking. My main hobby, however is travel and one of my goals in life is to eventually travel most of the world.</p>
